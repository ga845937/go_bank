# Simple golang project

## Using packages

1. gin (webFramework)
2. entgo (orm)
3. Elastic APM (gin, sql driver)
4. zap + lumberjack (log + rotate)
5. godotenv (config)

## gin middleware

1. apmgin (apm)
2. logger (the logger part will write to both log files and console, log files will be split by date)
3. validator (request parameter validation)
4. responser (uniform response format)

## Project Structure

Adopting a modular pattern to achieve optimal readability, maintainability, and scalability, and to clearly delineate responsibilities.

## Project Description

1. Basic implementation of the gin framework
2. Equipped with commonly used, practical, and essential middleware
3. Utilizing entgo as the ORM (Why not gorm? Because entgo is open-sourced by Meta)
4. Experimenting with the CQRS architecture, and using channels to achieve the optimal scenario ( wallet transaction )

## Known Issues

1. Files auto-generated by entimport incorrectly import the `field` package as "gorm.io/gen/field" instead of the correct "entgo.io/ent/schema/field".
2. Auto-generated files by entimport have incorrect placement for ForeignKey Optional.
3. In auto-generated files by entimport, if the schema type includes UUID, the Field will be incorrect.
4. After the initial installation of entimport, there will be an error with a proto package. Commenting out the erroneous line will resolve the issue.
